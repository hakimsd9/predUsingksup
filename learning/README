compareBaselines: Compare performance of ksupport regularized logistic regression to ridge regression and a simple learner that takes a single best variable for prediction

computeAucs: Compute aucs for ksupport/l1/l2 regularized logistic regression. The results are saved in a matrix auc that can be used to perform wilcoxon signed rank or other statistical tests

correlationMatrices: Plot the correlation matrix of the main variables (list in "highestWeightedVars") taking one column for each variable (topVarsOneCol.csv)

scalabilityPlots: Code to obtain the scalability plots comparing, for l1, l2 and ksupport regularization (with different values of k) the convergence time
